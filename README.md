# RBPMS-counting-macro
An ImageJ macro for counting RBPMS-stained retinal ganglion cells from whole mount images

# Installation instructions
This macro depends on Thomas Boudier's 3D ImageJ Suite, particularly the 3D Edge and Symmetry Filter plugin.  Installation instructions for the 3D ImageJ Suite are available on the [documentation wiki](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start). 

To use this macro, clone or download the repository.  The `Counter.ijm` file can then be dragged and dropped directly into Fiji and run from the macro editor.
